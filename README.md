# My First version of Portfolio written in Reactjs

## Intro

After learning Reactjs for a month, I built my own portfolio referencing multiple other Tutorials and Websites.

While my abilities as a Reactjs dev is still limited, I managed to bring something out of it and satisfied with the result.

## How to run

After cloning the project, first  

### `npm install`

and then

### `npm run start`

to run the app.

## Further Improvement Plans

While I want to keep improving and updating the site to keep it as flawless and elegant as possible, I simply do not have extra time to dwell on this one. 

But there will be future versions of My portfolio when I level up.
